Tweeter is a simple, single-page Twitter clone. This project focuses on the use of the following front-end skills: jQuery, HTML5, client-side JS, AJAX and CSS. Additionally, Node, Express and MongoDB are also used as back-end skills. The base of this project is forked and cloned from the [Lighthouse Labs' Tweeter](https://github.com/lighthouse-labs/tweeter) repository.
